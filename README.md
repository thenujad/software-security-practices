### 🔐 Buffer Overflow

**Folder**: `buffer_overflow`

1. **Safe User Input Handling** (`safe_input.c`):
    - 🛠️ This example demonstrates safe user input handling using `fgets()` to prevent buffer overflow.
    - 🧑‍💻 It reads a username and ensures that it does not exceed the buffer size.
    - ✂️ Uses `strcspn` to remove any newline characters.

2. **Unsafe Input Handling** (`unsafe_input.c`):
    - 🚨 Demonstrates unsafe input handling by using `gets()`, which can cause buffer overflow.
    - ❌ This code should be avoided in production environments due to security vulnerabilities.
  
3. **Safe String Copy and Dynamic Allocation** (`safe_string_copy.c`):
    - 🔏 This code illustrates how to safely copy strings using `strncpy()` and dynamically allocate memory for formatted strings using `snprintf()` and `malloc()`.

### 🗄️ Database Security

**Folder**: `database_security`

1. **Login Form (Frontend)** (`login.html`):
    - 🖥️ A simple HTML form for user login.
    - 📮 It submits the user's credentials (username and password) via POST method to the server.

2. **Login Script (Backend)** (`login.php`):
    - 🛠️ PHP script to handle user login with connection to a MySQL database.
    - ⚠️ This script contains a vulnerability by directly embedding user input into an SQL query, which is susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.
    - 🛡️ It demonstrates the use of SQL statements to check for valid login credentials.

### 🚧 Secure Coding Practices for Error Handling

**Folder**: `error_handling`

1. **Express Server with Input Validation and Logging** (`server.js`):
    - ⚙️ A Node.js application using Express and rate-limiting middleware.
    - 🛡️ This code validates the user's email and username input with the `validator` library.
    - 📝 Implements error handling and logging using the `winston` library to capture and log errors.
    - ⏱️ Demonstrates rate-limiting to protect against brute force attacks.

2. **Registration Form** (`index.html`):
    - 📝 A frontend registration form that sends a POST request to the server.
    - ✅ The form contains fields for username and email with basic client-side validation before sending the data to the server.

3. **Configuration File** (`package.json`):
    - 📦 Defines the project dependencies such as `express` and `validator`.
    - 🔧 This file also specifies the scripts and version of the Node.js project.

### ✅ Secure Coding Practices for Input Validation

**Folder**: `input_validation`

1. **User Registration Form** (`registration.html`):
    - 📄 HTML form that allows users to register by entering personal information such as name, username, email, profile picture, and password.
    - 🛡️ This form includes client-side validation to ensure correct input format.

2. **Validation Script** (`validation.js`):
    - 💻 JavaScript file that provides comprehensive validation for user inputs.
    - 🧹 Validates the following fields:
      - Name: Ensures that only letters and spaces are allowed.
      - Username: Only alphanumeric characters are allowed.
      - Email: Validates the format of the email.
      - Profile Picture: Ensures that only certain file types (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`) are accepted.
      - Password: Must contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
    - ❌ Displays error messages below each field when the input is invalid.

### 🔒 Secure Coding Practices for Session Management

**Folder**: `session_management`

1. **Session Handling Script** (`session.php`):
    - 🛠️ A PHP script that demonstrates secure session management.
    - 🔐 Utilizes `session_start()` to initiate a session and sets secure cookie parameters.
    - ♻️ Implements session regeneration to prevent session fixation attacks.
    - 🔒 Contains functionality to destroy the session upon user logout.

2. **Session Configuration** (`config.php`):
    - ⚙️ A configuration file that specifies settings for session handling, including session lifetime and storage settings.
    - 🛡️ Ensures that sensitive session data is not exposed and follows best practices for session security.

### 🧪 Test Recap Security

**Folder**: `recaptcha_security`

1. **Login Form with reCAPTCHA (Frontend)** (`login.html`):
    - 🖥️ An HTML form that integrates Google reCAPTCHA for user authentication.
    - 📮 It includes fields for username and password, along with a reCAPTCHA widget to verify that the user is not a bot.
    - ✅ The form submits data via POST method to the server for processing.

2. **Login Script (Backend)** (`login.js`):
    - 🛠️ A Node.js script that handles login requests and verifies reCAPTCHA responses.
    - 🔒 It checks whether the reCAPTCHA response is present and valid by making a request to Google's reCAPTCHA API.
    - ⚠️ Upon successful verification, it checks the username and password against hardcoded values (as a placeholder for real credential verification).
    - 📜 Implements error handling for reCAPTCHA verification failures and logs any errors that occur.

3. **Stylesheet** (`style.css`):
    - 🎨 A CSS file that styles the login form for a clean and user-friendly interface.
    - 📱 It provides styles for the login box, input fields, buttons, and responsive design for various screen sizes.

### ⚔️ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

**Folder**: `cross_site_scripting`

1. **Unsecure Node.js Application for Reflected XSS** (`reflected-unsecure.js`):
    - ⚠️ Demonstrates a vulnerable Node.js application where user input is reflected directly into the HTML without sanitization.
    - 🚨 Can be tested by submitting a `<script>alert("Reflected XSS Attack!")</script>` payload to trigger an alert.

2. **Secure Node.js Application for Reflected XSS** (`reflected-secure.js`):
    - 🛡️ This version uses the `escape-html` module to sanitize user input before rendering it to prevent the execution of script tags.
    - ✅ Protects the application from reflected XSS attacks by encoding user input.

3. **Unsecure Node.js Application for Stored XSS** (`stored-unsecure.js`):
    - ⚠️ An example of a vulnerable application where user comments are stored and rendered without sanitization.
    - 🛑 Demonstrates stored XSS by allowing `<script>` payloads to execute whenever the page is reloaded.

4. **Secure Node.js Application for Stored XSS** (`stored-secure.js`):
    - 🛡️ Uses the `xss` module to sanitize user input before storing and rendering it.
    - ✅ Prevents the execution of malicious scripts, securing the application from stored XSS attacks.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1. **Buffer Overflow Examples**:
   - 💻 Compile the C code using GCC (or any other C compiler).
     ```bash
     gcc safe_input.c -o safe_input
     ./safe_input
     ```

2. **Database Security**:
   - 🛠️ Set up a local MySQL server.
   - 🗃️ Create a database `sample_app` and a table `users`.
   - 💾 Insert sample data and run the `login.php` script using a PHP server (e.g., XAMPP or LAMP stack).

3. **Secure Error Handling (Node.js)**:
   - 🗂️ Navigate to the `error_handling` folder and run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     node server.js
     ```

4. **Input Validation**:
   - 🌐 Open the `registration.html` file in a web browser and interact with the form.
   - 🛠️ For server-side validation, integrate the `validation.js` with backend code (e.g., in a Node.js/Express or PHP server).

5. **Session Management**:
   - 🛠️ Open the `session.php` script in a PHP server environment to test session handling functionalities.
   - ⚙️ Ensure that session settings in `config.php` are configured correctly to enhance security.


6. **Test Recap Security**:
   - 💻 Set up a Node.js environment and install necessary dependencies.
   - 🏃‍♂️ Run the server script to test the login functionality with reCAPTCHA.
   - 🖥️ Access the login form through a web browser and attempt to log in using various inputs to verify the reCAPTCHA and login process.


7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Examples**:
   - 🗂️ Navigate to the `cross_site_scripting` folder.
   - 💻 Install required dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install express body-parser escape-html xss
     ```
   - 🏃‍♂️ Run the desired example using:
     ```bash
     node reflected-unsecure.js
     node reflected-secure.js
     node stored-unsecure.js
     node stored-secure.js
     ```

   - 🖥️ Access each application on their respective ports (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for `reflected-unsecure.js`, `http://localhost:3001` for `reflected-secure.js`, etc.) and test with provided payloads to observe secure and unsecure behaviors.


## 💡 Notes

- 🛡️ Always ensure that proper input validation and error handling practices are followed in production environments to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- ⚠️ SQL injection, buffer overflow, and reCAPTCHA validation are common vulnerabilities that must be mitigated using safe coding practices.
- 📘 For more details on securing web applications, refer to OWASP's guidelines and best practices.
